Report for Web Development(CS1534) Assignment 1

- General theme
The general theme ended up boing a bit more simply than I would have liked due to the small issue I ran into of really struggling to workout how to use the layout. As a result of this however, making the website work to be readable on a mobile device was quite a bit easier. 

Also not that it was to important but I really struggled to write a lot about my home town because, to put it nicely, it's quite boring and very little has come from it. This also made it quite difficult to actually test how the page might look on a larger screen as the text ardly took up 2 lines on the screen. This was made easier by adding an amount of padding on the left and right which comapcted the text enough to make it look like a proper paragraph of text was there.

The nav button were fortunately rather easy to implement and marking them as green and red just made it a bit easier for the user to tell what page they were on. Making it mostly mobile compatable was not to bad as the items were already small enough onto the screen.

- Home Page
The map should have been more simple than I found it. Annyoyingly when I added the image it was absolutely huge. This was fortunately  fixed by making the image width a % rather than just a number in the CSS. Also adding the link to it so you could go to OSM yourself if you wanted to.

The images that were implemented were a bit easier than I expected. I had intially tried to do it out of a div which, unsuprsingly, didn't work very well and just created problems that the page didn't even have before. Fortunately however, after implemeting it with a div it became much easier. I did still somewhat struggle with the text below the images for a bit until finally realising I should have used class > p to jsut edit that part, rather than trying to make it work even in the normal paragraph.

The Credits weren't to hard to implement as they are just text with imbeded links. I initally tried to implement it as a list however ran into more formatting issues, which was actually cause of a lot of problems I ran into, but just settled with doing a few <a>s

- History page
The history essentially follows the same strucutre as the home page. So most problems I ran into here were fixed when I had fixed them in the Home page.

- Visit Page
I realised the colomuns part of the bootstrap was something that I just could not wrap my head round for the life of me so I Just had to drop it and try and get some stuff on the page.
