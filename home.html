            Kirkcaldy is a small town found along the central belt of Scotland. It is located within the Fife region with the main areas around it being Dunfermline, and Glenrothes (but Falkland is my favourite bit). It is one of Fifes larger settelments holding around 60,000 people. Nicknamed the "Lang toun," in reference the to the length of the main street. It also, in my opinion, has some of the worst schools in the entire country. Dysart was also absorbed into Krikcaldy in 1930 under an act of parlialment hoever, the Dysart region still retains a large amount of it own indentity. The town is no more or less rainny than the rest of the UK. It has some large-ish beaches and is relatively flat. It has a few main regions that make up the town and 4 High schools.
